# biostat777-intro-Sydney-Lewis

I created the website as part of Project 1 for the Statistical Programming Paradigms and Workflows course, which is taught by Dr. Stephanie Hicks at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This website is developed using Quarto. I deployed my website to https://sydlewis.github.io/biostat777-intro-Sydney-Lewis/ using GitHub Pages.
