# biostat777-intro-Sydney-Lewis

I (Sydney Lewis) created the website as part of Project 1 for the Statistical Programming Paradigms and Workflows course, which is taught by Dr. Stephanie Hicks at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 

This website was developed using Quarto. I deployed my website to https://sydlewis.github.io/biostat777-intro-Sydney-Lewis/ using GitHub Pages.
