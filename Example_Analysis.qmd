# Research Question

**How does recreational substance use vary across age and sex?**

A person's relationship with substance use is dynamic and may change throughout their life. Researchers are often interested in exploring how different groups of people use recreational drugs. Recently, there have been increased concerns about the interaction of substance use and mental health issues for youth[@panchal_recent_2022]. Other reports have described increased binge drinking and marijuana use among middle aged adults[@richtel_middle-aged_2023] and substance use disorders among older adults[@span_substance_2023]. While men are more likely to use substances than women[@noauthor_sex_nodate], stigmatization contributes to women being less likely to connect with substance use treatment resources[@krug_women_2023]. Overall, understanding how different groups of people interact with recreational drugs helps medical and public health professionals better support these impacted groups.

In this analysis, I am interested in further exploring how substance use varies across age and sex in the United States. To do so, I will be using survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This analysis is intended for anyone interested in public health and trends related to these important topics.

# Data Source

::: column-margin
![](hhs-samhsa.jpg) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) administers the NSDUH. The agency focuses on behavioral health and was established by congress in 1992. As noted in the SAMHSA's Strategic Plan[@noauthor_samhsas_2023], the agency's top five priorities are:

-   Preventing Overdose

-   Enhancing Access to Suicide Prevention and Crisis Care

-   Promoting Resilience and Emotional Health for Children, Youth and Families

-   Integrating Behavioral and Physical Health Care

-   Strengthening the Behavioral Health Workforce
:::

I used data from the 2021 [National Survey of Drug Use and Health](https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm) (NSDUH). The NSDUH has been conducted by the U.S. government since 1971. This survey explores questions related to substance use, mental health, and other health concerns. I downloaded the data via [this link](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2021-nsduh-2021-ds0001). The associated codebook can be found [here](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/field-uploads-protected/studies/NSDUH-2021/NSDUH-2021-datasets/NSDUH-2021-DS0001/NSDUH-2021-DS0001-info/2021NSDUHmrbCAISpecs011321.pdf).

# Data Wrangling

Throughout this analysis, I used data collected about consumption of cigarettes, cigars, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, and inhalants. While I focused on these recreational drugs in this analysis, the NSDUH explores different types of substances, including prescription medications, as well as specific substances within a class of drugs, such as LSD.

I primarily used tidyverse functions to clean and transform my data. I have added comments to the included code to describe my steps.

# Analysis and Results

## Substances Ever Used Across Age

**How does any lifetime drug use vary across age?**

I used survey data asking respondents whether they had ever used a substance in their life. Fewer people have tried substances traditionally thought of as "harder drugs," like heroin and meth, than legal substances, like alcohol and cigarettes. In older age groups, there are wider gaps in exposure across the different substances. In addition, there are trends related to certain substances being more popular among certain age groups. Inhalants are more popular relative to other substances in younger age groups. In the 30 to 34 age group and those younger, marijuana is more likely to have been tried than cigarettes, but this trend is reversed in older age groups.

## Visualization Note

Please note that these age categories are not of equal size. These are the same age categories used in the NSDUH survey. The dashed lines connecting the points are meant to help illustrate trends across these age groups, but not to imply continuous age data.

## Substances Ever Used across Sex

**How does any lifetime drug use vary across age *and sex*?**

This analysis uses the same survey questions as the previous section, though the responses are grouped by sex, which was recorded as a binary variable in the survey data. In most cases, the percentage of male participants who have experimented with these substances in greater than the percentage of female participants. This gender gap in lifetime substance use experience appears to be larger in older age groups.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Visualization Note

Please note that the scales on the y-axis are not identical across the faceted plots for the next two visualizations. Because of the wide variation in prevalence of use for these different substances, I chose to adjust the y-axis' scale in order to clarify the use differences across sex.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
substance_ever_sex <- nsduh_2021_v1 %>%

## Recent Substance Use Across Age and Sex

**How does recent drug use vary across age and sex?**

In this section, I used survey data about more recent substance use. I chose to define "recent use" as happening in the last 12 months across all substances. Similar to the responses related to any lifetime use in my earlier visualization, male respondents are overall more likely to use these substances than female participants.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
proportion_lastyear <- nsduh_2021_v1 %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(cig_lastyear, cigar_lastyear, alc_lastyear, mj_lastyear, coc_lastyear, her_lastyear, halluc_lastyear, meth_lastyear, inhal_lastyear), names_to = "Substance", values_to = "Last_Year") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Last_Year)) %>%

         substance_label = case_when(
           Substance == "cig_lastyear" ~ "Cigarettes",

           Substance == "meth_lastyear" ~ "Methamphetamine",
           Substance == "inhal_lastyear" ~ "Inhalants",
           TRUE ~ NA
         ))

## Age of Substance Use Initiation

**When are people most likely to try a drug for the first time?**

To explore this question, I used survey data asking respondents about the age of their first use of a substance. While this data was numeric with integers for age, I chose to instead create age group categories. For nearly all of the substances, the age group 15-19 is the most common time when people use a drug for the first time. In general, substances generally considered "harder drugs" are initiated at older ages than drugs that do not have this same connotation.

```{r, warning = FALSE}

# Summary

As represented in the NSDUH survey data, substance use varies widely across age and sex. There are gender and age gaps in the number of respondents who have ever used and recently used these substances. These trends are amplified in specific substances. In general, respondents were most likely to have first tried a substance in their later teenage years. One possible limitation of this analysis is the use of survey data, which relies on self-reported substance use. This analysis is only the tip of the iceberg in exploring demographic differences in substance use. I am so excited to continue learning about statistical analyses and epidemiology so that I will become better equipped to continue exploring these questions and investigating these topics.
