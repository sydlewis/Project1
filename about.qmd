## 🍉 Bio

I'm studying epidemiology with a focus on pharmacoepidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I'm especially looking forward to learning more about drug safety, utilization, and effectiveness. 

Outside of school, I love to run 👟, sew 🧵, and cook 🥗. I'm originally from Southern California and I'm having so much fun exploring Baltimore!
