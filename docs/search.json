Fewer people have tried substances traditionally thought of as ‚Äúharder drugs,‚Äù like heroin and meth, than legal substances, like alcohol and cigarettes. In older age groups, there are wider gaps in exposure across the different substances. In addition, there are trends related to certain substances being more popular among certain age groups. Inhalants are more popular relative to other substances in younger age groups. In the 30 to 34 age group and those younger, marijuana is more likely to have been tried than cigarettes, but this trend is reversed in older age groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization Note\n\n\n\nPlease note that these age categories are not of equal size.
